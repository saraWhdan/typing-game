## Local Storage
This typing game uses  local storage to save the user's selected difficulty level. When the user selects a difficulty level, it is stored in the browser's local storage so that the next time they play the game, the selected difficulty level will be preselected for them.

Please note that local storage is only available within the browser in which it was set. If the user clears their browser data, their saved difficulty level will also be cleared.
